# Proxy variables for three subcultures for U.S. Gun Culture Research

## About
This repository contains the component data derived from a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on gun culture in the United States, spanning from 1998 to 2016, segmented by state and year. These components are proxies for different dimensions of gun culture and can be utilized in further statistical analyses. These variables are the outputs of the analysis detailed in the following paper: Boine, C., Siegel, M., Ross, C. et al. [What is gun culture? Cultural variations and trends across the United States](https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-020-0520-6). Humanit Soc Sci Commun 7, 21 (2020). 

## Data Description
The dataset encompasses three components that serve as proxies for distinct aspects of gun culture:
1. **Recreational Culture Component**: Data related to recreational firearm use.
2. **Self-Defense Culture Component**: Data on firearms used for self-defense.
3. **Second Amendment Activism Component**: Data reflecting political activism around gun rights.

Values are provided for each U.S. state over the years 1998-2016.

## Usage
This data can be employed in exploring various facets of gun culture within statistical models or comparative studies.

## Data Format
Provided in spreadsheet format, each row denotes a state-year combination, with columns for each PCA component.

## Limitations
Based on PCA conducted on data available between 1998 and 2016, the variables reflect the patterns and relationships in gun culture at that time.
